## eMMC Module & SPI Flash Module

ROCK 5A provides a high-speed B2B interface for eMMC / SPI Flash, which can be used for operating system and data storage. When you receive ROCK 5A, ROCK 5A is installed with SPI Flash, you need to remove the SPI Flash before you install eMMC. Both eMMC and SPI Flash use B2B connectors, and they can be aligned with the B2B connection interface of ROCK 5A for installation. When installing, please align the missing corner of the module with the pattern area on the PCB, as shown in the figure:
